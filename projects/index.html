      <h4>Bryan Van De Veire</h4>
      <p>Welcome to Bryan’s website for MC 232: Website Design! Bryan Van De Veire was born and raised in Pueblo, Colorado and is currently a student at Colorado State University Pueblo working towards earning his bachelor’s degree in Mass Communications with an emphasis in Electronic Media as well as an emphasis in Honors. After college he aspires to buy his own house and find a good paying job that is close to his hometown so he can stay relatively close to my family. He is hopeful that one day he can start his own Tie-Dye T-shirt business and become an entrepreneur, so he is not forced to work for someone else the rest of his life. In his free time, he enjoys playing video games, riding his BMX bike, rock climbing, and cliff jumping since those have always been activities that he has always been good at. His favorite accomplishment in college so far would have to be whenever he worked with the Honors program to create a STEM program at Baca Elementary School teaching children how to create sustainable gardens and the importance of gardening. Overall, he still has lots of learning and living to do since he is still extremely young at 22 years old, but he is hopeful that these lessons that he has learned in life and college will lead to him living a life that spreads positive changes throughout his local community. </p>
